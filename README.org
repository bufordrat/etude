#+DESCRIPTION: Experimental additions to OCaml Prelude library
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil, num:nil

* Description

This is set of general-purpose library functions intended to build on
Keith Waclena's [[https://www2.lib.uchicago.edu/keith/software/prelude/Prelude.html][Prelude]] library.  This is freshly typed up so right
now no comments or docstrings.  However, as the code matures I intend
to add documentation, =odig= documentation, and unit tests.
