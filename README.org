#+DESCRIPTION: Experimental additions to OCaml Prelude library
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil, num:nil

* Description

This is set of general-purpose library functions intended to build on
Keith Waclena's [[https://www2.lib.uchicago.edu/keith/software/prelude/Prelude.html][Prelude]], which is a third-party standard library for
OCaml.  If any of them end up being actually useful, who knows?  Maybe
they'll even get incorporated into [[https://www2.lib.uchicago.edu/keith/software/prelude/Prelude.html][Prelude]].  This code is highly in
progress, so for the moment there are no comments or docstrings.
However, as the code matures I intend to flesh out this README, add
=odig= documentation, and property-based tests.
