#+DESCRIPTION: Experimental additions to OCaml Prelude library
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil, num:nil

* Description

This is set of general-purpose library functions intended to build on
Keith Waclena's [[https://www2.lib.uchicago.edu/keith/software/prelude/Prelude.html][Prelude]], which is a third-party standard library for
OCaml.  If any of them end up being actually useful, who knows?  Maybe
one or two will even get incorporated into [[https://www2.lib.uchicago.edu/keith/software/prelude/Prelude.html][Prelude]] some day.  

The main thing I'm doing currently is setting up module types and
module functors in such a way that boilerplate definitions of monad,
functor, and applicative operations can be automatically generated
from minimal definitions of =pure= and =bind=.  

This code is highly in progress, so for the moment there are no
comments or docstrings.  However, as the code matures I intend to
flesh out this README, add =odig= documentation, and property-based
tests.
