#+DESCRIPTION: Experimental additions to OCaml Prelude library
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil, num:nil

* Description

This is a set of extensions to Keith Waclena's [[https://www2.lib.uchicago.edu/keith/software/prelude/Prelude.html][Prelude]], which is a
third-party standard library for OCaml.  It adds standard functor,
applicative, and monad boilerplate-generating code, some basic
machinery for traversals, and monoids and semigroups.  It is still
very much under construction, but the =main= branch is intended to be
stable enough for use in production.

* Requirements

This code requires [[https://www2.lib.uchicago.edu/keith/software/prelude/Prelude.html][Prelude]] to be exposed to your compiler/toplevel.
