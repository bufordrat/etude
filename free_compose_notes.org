* TODO ComposeRun : functor (Intr1 : RUN) -> (Intr2 : RUN) -> RUN
  + takes two underlying functors with run functions, and outputs a run for
    their composition
* TODO RunFree : functor (Intr : RUN) -> RUN
  + takes an underlying (composed) functor with a run function and outputs a
    free monad version of it with a fun function
* TODO ComposeFree : functor (Intr1 : RUN) -> (Intr2 : RUN) -> RUN
  + takes two underlying functors with fun functions and outputs a free monad
    compoisition of them with a run function
